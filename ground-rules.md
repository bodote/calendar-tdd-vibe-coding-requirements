# general rules
* instead of using default values for tool usage , just ask me first what parameters i would like to use.
e.g. when running the spring boot initializr ask me for the java version i want to use, and ask for the "groupId"
* use Test Driven Development and the "test first" approach, always write a test first according to a requirement and its acceptance criteria, then query the user to check if the test is correct, then implement the code until the test is green.
* use a hexagonal architecture, the code should be organized in a way that the domain logic is separated from the infrastructure code.
* if there is a problem, wouldnt it be more efficient to enable more debugging output so that we can see, where there problem is ?
* for example: use any debug options to exactly see how spring boot does resolve the requested path if the spring boot does respond with a http status 404 not found
