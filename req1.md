# Requirement 1: View "woodle" with "hello world" content

*   add a automatic test that checks if the project contains a view to "woodle" with "hello world" as content on path /index.html
*   implement the view using the JTE template engine 
*   check if the implementation fulfills the test
*  since we really don't want to have an implementation before we have a test and made sure that the test fails , don't put  the "hello world" already in the index.hmtl or index.jte
